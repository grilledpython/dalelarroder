# Who am I?

I am <b>Arpan Mandal</b>. A boy from the state of West Bengal present in the east of India. I was born in the 2000's and currently am completing my high school education. I really like studying until it comes to things that should be memorized forcefully. I love eating spicy junk food but never gain weight. That there is the most annoying thing of my life. I can have a full garbage diet one day but would fail to gain even 1 Kg of weight the next day. This is why, I look very skinny. Not because I don't get nutrition but because my stomach has more power than my brain.

<p>I would have got many hobbies if I had much time to get out of my house; but, unfortunately, that's not the case with me. Anyways I mostly like spending time alone, listening music and coding projects. Sometimes it just gets all boring and that is when I move to my couch to watch cool cinemas <i>(If there is no work to do of course, orelse my mother would not miss an opportunity to scold me for being casual while having a pile of work to do)</i>. </p>

<p>Nowadays, I am a bit busy due to my major exam, the "<i>Matriculation</i>" in which I really want to score good <i>(It's the only way I can choose the career of my choice.)</i> Orelse yes, I am not that type of student you'd expect who would sit in front of the book all day long. That's just a different type of human being for me. Maybe that's all that you need to know about me <i>(Or maybe that's what I think because my brain can't get more information about myself.)</i></p>
