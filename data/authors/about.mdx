I am currently a Backend Engineer and Developer at [WaveBay](https://sail.arpan.codes).
I am also the Founder of Blu Club, a freelancing and coding community that has more than 600 members.
Nowadays, I am more focussed on Web Development, Cloud and Hosting than I am interested about anything else. I like to make stuff that helps people with their own projects. I mainly work on Javascript, Python and ofcourse HTML.
